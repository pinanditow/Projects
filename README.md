# Travel Insurance Business Recommendation
This project's outcome is to produce a business recommendation that can help the company to perform a more accurate customer acquisition method for their specific product: Travel Insurance. In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis of over 20,000 customers in the company's database using Python, engineer features to find insights about customers' behavior based on their background, visualize the result using seaborn and pandas, create a predictive model using K-means, and deliver the business recommendation.

# Decreasing The Number of Customers with Difficulties
The goal of this project is to produce a business recommendation based on customer datasets of **Home Credit Indonesia**, that can help the company to increase their accuracy on accepting/declining customers' loan submissions based on their background and automatically decrease the number of customers with difficulties on loan payments. In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis of over 350,000 customers using Python and SQL, visualize the result using Matplotlib, and create a predictive model using Logistic Regression to finally deliver a business recommendation.

# Build a Data Platform as a Verification Center for The Field Officers of Regional Education Institutions
**Kampus Mengajar** is a program that engaged with many participants and beneficiaries, such as 20,000+ College Students, 2000+ lecturers from more than 700 universities, and multiple regional institutions that operate in the field of education under The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. One of the most crucial parts of the program is choosing the right targets. This platform helps all of the related institutions as the field officers to verify the data of schools all around Indonesia and make sure the program is targeting the ones who need it the most.

# Build a Data Tracker Platform as an Information Center for Participants and Beneficiaries
**Kampus Mengajar** is a program that engaged with many participants and beneficiaries, such as 20,000+ College Students, 2000+ lecturers from more than 700 universities, and multiple regional institutions that operate in the field of education under The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. All of these participants and beneficiaries are always in need of updated information about the progress of the program, especially regarding the disbursement of funds. As a data analyst of Kampus Mengajar, I created a dynamic data tracker platform with Google Data Studio, which will automatically be updated on a daily basis. The platform is able to connect and compile information from multiple worksheets of every division. This platform efficiently reduces the workload of the Stakeholder Relation Division by 70%.
