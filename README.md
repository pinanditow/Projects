This project's outcome is to produce a business recommendation that can help the company to perform more accurate customer acquisition method for their specific product: Travel Insurance. In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis over 20,000 customers in company's database using Python, engineered features to find insights about customers behavior based on their background, visualize the result using seaborn and pandas, create predictive model using K-means, and deliver the business recommendation.

The dataset is from Kaggle.com, with the title [Travel Insurance Prediction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data)
