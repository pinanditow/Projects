# Build an Interactive Dashboard for Participants Status History

The stakeholders of Kampus Mengajar are always on demand to see how the participants journey through all the batches of Kampus Mengajar. Before there was a data analyst on the team, we used to share the data to all stakeholders with various spreadsheets based on their province and city. This method of communication is not efficient and takes time. As a data analyst joining the team, I created a dashboard as an information center for all different stakeholders, compiled in a one-to-go platform that can be accessed by everyone.

# Build a Data Tracker for Report Submission Progress
Kampus Mengajar is a program that assigns college students to schools in remote areas that are lagging in literacy and numeracy. Before these college students can contribute and create innovation in the school they are assigned to, they need to report themselves as an official from The Ministry of Education to education authorities in the city. As a data analyst, I create an active and dynamic dashboard tracker, connected to various active Google Forms for the report submission progress of every assigned participant and eventually make sure every authority gets informed.

# Class Attendance Tracker System for Lecturers
The basic concept of Kampus Mengajar is to send college students to schools in remote areas that are lagging in literacy and numeracy. Before these college students can contribute and create innovation in the school they are assigned to, they need some preparation classes to widen their knowledge and learn more about the education system. Therefore, Kampus Mengajar stages a full month of preparation classes for them to attend. As the data analyst of Kampus Mengajar, I created a dynamic data tracker platform with Google Data Studio, connected to various Google Form Responses Spreadsheets, which will automatically be updated every time the students submit their attendance. This platform efficiently helps the lecturers keep track of their class attendance, and with a personal-driven approach, they can determine each student's disciplinary and test scores.

# Build a Data-Driven Tracker on Disbursement of Funds Progress
Kampus Mengajar is a program that engages with many stakeholders and participants, contains more than 20.000+ College Students, 2000+ lecturers from more than 700 universities, and multiple regional institutions that operate in the field of education under The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. All of these stakeholders and participants are always in need of updated information about the program's current progression, especially regarding the disbursement of funds. As a data analyst of Kampus Mengajar, I created a dynamic data tracker platform with Google Data Studio, which will automatically be updated on a daily basis. The platform is able to connect and compile information from multiple worksheets of every division. This platform efficiently reduces the workload of the Stakeholder Relation Division by 70%.

# Decreasing The Number of Customers with Difficulties
The goal of this project is to produce a business recommendation based on customer datasets of **Home Credit Indonesia**, that can help the company to increase their accuracy on accepting/declining customers' loan submissions based on their background and automatically decrease the number of customers with difficulties on loan payments. In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis of over 350,000 customers using Python and SQL, visualize the result using Matplotlib, and create a predictive model using Logistic Regression to finally deliver a business recommendation.
